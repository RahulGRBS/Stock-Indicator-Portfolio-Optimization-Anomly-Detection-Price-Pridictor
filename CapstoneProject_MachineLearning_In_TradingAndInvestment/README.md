# MachineLearning in Trading and Investment
*Udacity - Data Scienctist Nano Degree : Final Capstone project)*

## Project Overview
*This is final capstone project in the series of the projects listed in my Nano Degree Program.*

This project has been learned and presented across varied financial stocks basics indicators and stock price anomaly detectors and predictors machine leaning algorithms.

How stock market world trade uses the graph and key indicators to analyse and take decisions. How. basic statistics concept implemented in python’s maths library help them to comprehend and anticipate the outcomes. It should be noted these concept are very old and in price prediction attempt which made is based on the assumption all of the factors are are constant and  only focus is given to Closing price. 
However in reality there n- numbers of factors which impact the price of a stock. The factors here presented are based on historical time-series data only. 

Even tough most of the trading is being based algorithm and every tech company tries to make Holy –Grail of stock market where they can predict the prices. But in reality stock prices are always out-smart the Machine Leaning algorithm. One cannot deny the fact the with introduction of mathematical models and high computing really helped in trading but its ML speculation is limited to high frequency and short maturity trading. Where logical constraints and threshold has been introduced . But when it comes to  Long maturity and very High Notional trading say trades with hindered of million with maturity of 20-30 years then comes the human intelligence.

Here is minuscule attempt is made in the step forward to learn and implement basics of machine learning

## Problem Highlights
-	The problem is  here to know the basic of stocks indicators i.e. how ,why and when they are used.
namely Bollingder curves , Cumulative and Daily Return , Sharpe Ratio, CAPM model (Alpha and Beta of the stocks) and compare them with one another and finally making an optimal Portfolio.
-	Secondly is to see the anomaly in the prices of stock wherein actual historic stocks prices are analysed and bucketed under some thresholds and Outliners are shown as Anomalies.
-	Lastly  LSTM is being used to predict the stock price after failed attempt of Linear Regression and Knn model
