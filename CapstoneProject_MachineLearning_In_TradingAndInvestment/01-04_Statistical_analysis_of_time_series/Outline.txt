Pandas makes it very convenient to compute various statistics on a dataframe:

Global statistics: mean, median, std, sum, etc. [more]
Rolling statistics: rolling_mean, rolling_std, etc. [more]
We will use these functions to analyze stock movement over time.

Specifically, we  will compute:

Bollinger Bands: A way of quantifying how far stock price has deviated from some norm.
Daily returns: Day-to-day change in stock price.
